    <h1>SpoorID Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 04, 2025</p>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how SpoorID ("we," "us," or "our") handles
      information when you use our iOS application (the "App"). Your privacy is
      important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our
      practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We believe in minimizing data collection. The App is designed to function
      without collecting or storing your personal information. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The App does not have a sign-up or
        registration feature. You can use the App anonymously without creating
        an account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, or
        have access to any personal information that can identify you, such as
        your name, email address, or phone number.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information We Process for Core Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      To provide the core feature of the App—analyzing photographs of animal
      scat—we need to process certain data. This data is handled as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Photographs:</strong> When you select a photograph for analysis,
        that photograph is sent to a third-party service for processing. The
        photograph is used solely for the purpose of providing the analysis and
        is not stored by us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Data (Optional):</strong> If you grant the App
        permission to access your location, the geographic coordinates (latitude
        and longitude) of where the photo was taken will be sent along with the
        photograph to the analysis service. This information is used to improve
        the accuracy of the analysis by providing geographical context.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Your consent for location data is entirely optional.</strong> You
      can deny or revoke this permission at any time through your device's iOS
      Settings. If you do not provide location permission, the analysis will be
      based solely on the visual information in the photograph.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses a third-party AI service to perform the analysis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service Provider:</strong> We use Google's Firebase AI services
        (specifically, the Gemini model) to analyze the photograph and location
        data you provide.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Handling:</strong> The data sent to Google (your photograph
        and optional location coordinates) is processed according to their
        privacy policy. We encourage you to review their policy to understand
        how they handle your data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google's Privacy Policy:</strong> You can find more information
        here:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
          >https://policies.google.com/privacy</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SpoorID does not store your photograph or location data on its servers
      after the analysis is complete. The data is processed ephemerally to
      provide the service. You have full control over this locally stored data
      and can delete any saved analysis from within the App at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the information transmitted from
      the App to the third-party analysis service. However, no method of
      transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
      Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
      your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App. You are
      advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
      Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
    </p>
