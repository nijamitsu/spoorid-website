    <h1>SpoorID Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      SpoorID ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the SpoorID
      mobile application (the "App").
    </p>
    <p>
      By using our App, you agree to the collection, storage, and use of your
      information as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable
      information. All data you enter into the App, specifically birthday
      information, is stored exclusively on your local device in the App's
      private, sandboxed container provided by the operating system. This data
      is necessary for the core functionality of the App, which is to track and
      count down to birthdays.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising
      services.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      The data you provide is stored locally on your device and is not
      transmitted to any external servers. We rely on the security features of
      your mobile operating system to protect the information stored within the
      App's sandbox. Please note that no method of electronic storage is 100%
      secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      The data you enter remains on your device for as long as you use the App
      and keep the data entries. You have full control over your data and can
      delete any or all of your birthday entries at any time from within the
      App. If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data associated with it
      will be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
      advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
