    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>What is SpoorID?</h3>
        <p>
          SpoorID is a mobile application designed to help you identify animal
          scat (droppings) using artificial intelligence. By taking a photo, you
          can get a suggestion of what animal may have left it behind, which is
          useful for hikers, wildlife enthusiasts, and nature lovers.

        <h3>How does the analysis work?</h3>
        <p>
          When you submit a photo, the app sends it to an advanced AI model for visual analysis. The AI has been trained to
          recognize the characteristics of scat from various animals. If you
          provide your location, the AI uses that as a secondary clue to improve
          the identification's accuracy based on known animal habitats.
        </p>

        <h3>How accurate is the identification?</h3>
        <p>
          The AI provides a likely identification based on the image provided,
          but it is not infallible. Accuracy can be affected by photo quality,
          lighting, and the distinctiveness of the scat. The analysis should be
          considered a well-educated suggestion, not a definitive scientific
          identification. Always be cautious around wildlife.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What should I do if the analysis is wrong or says my photo isn't scat?</h3>
        <p>
          The AI does its best, but it can make mistakes. If you get an
          inconclusive result, it may be because the image is unclear or the
          item photographed doesn't have enough features of scat for the AI to
          analyze confidently. We are continuously working to improve the
          model's accuracy.

        <h3>Is my data safe? What happens to my photos?</h3>
        <p>
          Your privacy is our priority. The photo and optional location data you
          submit are used only for the immediate purpose of performing the AI
          analysis. This data is processed ephemerally and is
          <strong>not</strong> stored on our servers after the analysis is
          complete.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Why does the app ask for my location? Do I have to provide it?</h3>
        <p>
          Providing your location is <strong>completely optional</strong>. It is
          used only to help the AI make a more accurate guess. For example,
          knowing a photo was taken in a region where bears live can help the
          AI differentiate between a bear and an animal from a different
          continent. If you decline to share your location, the analysis will
          still work using only the photo.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Where are my saved "Tracks" stored?</h3>
        <p>
          When you choose to save an analysis, it is stored
          <strong>only on your device</strong>. This data is never sent to our
          servers. You have full control and can view or delete your saved
          tracks at any time from within the app.
